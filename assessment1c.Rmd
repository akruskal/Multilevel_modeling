### Overview

In this assignment we are going to analyse the `Orthodont` data, available in the `nlme` package. These data include longitudinal information from a study at the University of North Carolina Dental School. Investigators followed the growth of children from age 8 until age 14. Every two years they measured the distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, two points that are easily identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.

This data frame contains the following four variables:

* **distance** A numeric vector of distances from the pituitary to the pterygomaxillary fissure (measured in mm). These distances are measured on x-ray images of the skull 

* **age** a numeric vector of ages of the subject (in years)

* **Subject** A unique person identifier indicating the subject on which the measurement was made. The levels are labelled M01 to M16 for the males and F01 to F13 for the females. 

* **Sex** a binary variable with levels Male and Female

As the `nlme` package is one of the core R packages, you donâ€™t need to separately install it. To get started, you just need to load it into the workspace in R with `library(nlme)` command. We will also use the function ggplot to produce figures. Load this into the workspace with `library(gglopt2)`.

Please provide the R code needed to answer the following exercises as well as your written answers to them.

####1. Familiarise yourself with the Orthodont dataset. 
    i. How many rows (observations) are there in the dataset, and how many children are there in the dataset? [3 marks]
    ii. Provide frequencies (%) for the categories of the categorical variables, and median and 1st and 3rd quartiles for the continuous variables. [3 marks]
    
#####i)
``` {r 1i, message = FALSE}
print(paste('There are', dim(Orthodont)[1], 'rows of observations.'))
print(paste('There are', length(unique(Orthodont$Subject)), 'children in the dataset.'))

```
  
There are 108 rows of observations and 27 children in the dataset.
     
#####ii)
```{r 1ii, echo = FALSE}
summary(Orthodont)
print('Percentages Male/Female')
prop.table(table(Orthodont$Sex))*100

```


####2. In this assignment, we are interested in modelling the variable **distance** as a function of **age** and **sex**. 
    i) What is the multilevel structure of this dataset? [3 marks]
    ii) Age will be modelled as a random effect for the analysis. Why might this be appropriate? [5 marks]
    iii) Use the function `ggplot()` and the following code to produce a scatterplot of age by distance, separately for each sex. Summarise the relationship between distance, age and sex. [3 marks]
    
#####i)
```{r 2i, echo = FALSE}
grViz("digraph flowchart {
      # node definitions with substituted label text
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']
      tab5 [label = '@@5']
      tab6 [label = '@@6']

      # edge definitions with the node IDs
      tab1 -> tab3 -> tab4;
      tab2 -> tab5 -> tab6;
      }

      [1]: 'Male'
      [2]: 'Female'
      [3]: 'Patient (Level 2)'
      [4]: 'Age 1 -> Age 2 -> Age 3 -> Age 4 (Level 1)'
      [5]: 'Patient (Level 2)'
      [6]: 'Age 1 -> Age 2 -> Age 3 -> Age 4 (Level 1)'
      ")

```
    
#####ii)
Age is an appropriate random effect for the analysis because we are trying to determine what the effect of age is on the distance between the pituitary and pterygomaxillary fissure. If we considered age a fixed effect, we would not be able to see the difference in size by age. 


#####iii)
    
``` {r 2iii, echo=FALSE}
    scatter <- ggplot(Orthodont, aes(age, distance, color= Sex))
    scatter + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) + 
        facet_wrap(~Sex) + 
        labs(x = "Age (years)", y = " Distance (pituitary to pterygomaxillary fissure) (mm) ", colour= "Sex")
```

Male and female Children appear to have an increased distance between the pituitary and pterygomaxillary fissure as they increase in age, but males seem to have a larger increase in distance with respect to age compared to females.


####3. We will now begin to build a regression model to further investigate the relationship between **distance**, **age** and **sex**. We would like to test the hypothesis that age and sex are significantly related to distance. 
    i) Create a single-level intercept-only model for distance. [3 marks]
    
```{r 3i}
single_level_model <- gls(distance ~ 1, 
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)

```
    
    ii) Create a variance-components (intercept only) model for distance with a random intercept. [3 marks] 

```{r 3ii}
variance_components_model <- lme(distance ~ 1, random = ~1|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)

variance_components_model_lmer <-lmer(distance ~ (1|Subject), 
                                      data=Orthodont, REML = FALSE)

```

    iii) Perform a likelihood ratio test to compare the goodness-of-fit of the two models in 3i) and 3b). [3 marks]
    
```{r 3iii}
logLik(single_level_model)  
logLik(variance_components_model)
```

    iv) What proportion of the variation in distance is at the individual level? [3 marks]

```{r 3iv}

vc1 <- as.data.frame(VarCorr(variance_components_model_lmer))
sig_u_sq <- vc1[1,4]
sig_e_sq <- vc1[2,4]

vpc <- sig_u_sq/(sig_u_sq + sig_e_sq)
vpc

```

The proportion of the variation in distance at the individual level is approximately 42%.
  
    v) In this study, is it justified to use a hierarchical model? [3 marks]
    
It is Justified to use a hiercarchal model because  the patient is a relatively large explanation for the variance in size and the log likelyhood is larger for the empty variance components model.

####4. We will now incorporate the variable **age** into the model created in 3ii) above. 
    i) Create a longitudinal multilevel linear model with random intercept only to investigate the effect of age on distance (distance ~ age). [3 marks]

```{r 4i}

long_randint_linear_model <- lme(distance ~ age, random = ~1|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)
```

    ii) Now add a random slope to the variable age in the longitudinal multilevel linear model created in 4i). [3 marks]
    
    ```{r 4ii}

long_randslope_linear_model <- lme(distance ~ age, random = ~ 1 + age|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)
    ```
    
    iii) Perform a likelihood ratio test to compare the goodness-of-fit of the two models in 4i) and 4ii). [3 marks]
    
```{r 4iii}
anova(long_randint_linear_model, long_randslope_linear_model)
```
    
    
    iv)  What is the sign of the estimated covariance parameter from the random part of the model, and what does this suggest about the relationship between random intercepts and random slopes? [6 marks]

```{r 4vi}
summary(long_randslope_linear_model)
```
The covarianace parameter is negative which suggests that as people age, the distance between the fissures become less varied, but it is not a large correlation.

    v) Draw a plot to help assess whether the posterior estimates of the random intercepts and random slopes are normally distributed. [6 marks]

```{r 4v}
Orthodont$age_factor <- factor(Orthodont$age)

boxplot_Orth <- ggplot(Orthodont, aes(x = age_factor, y = distance)) +        geom_boxplot() + 
scale_y_continuous(name = "Fissure Distance", limits=c(15, 35)) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line", aes(group=1))  + 
stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point") 

boxplot_Orth

boxplot_sex <- ggplot(Orthodont, aes(x = age_factor, y = distance)) +        geom_boxplot() + 
scale_y_continuous(name = "Fissure Distance", limits=c(15, 35)) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line", aes(group=1))  + 
stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point") +
facet_wrap(~Sex)

boxplot_sex

plot(Orthodont)
```

    vi) In this study, does the use of a random slope for age improve the goodness-of-fit of the model? [3 marks] 
    
    The random slope for age does not appear to improve the goodness-of-fit for the model, with almost exactly the same AIC of about 451, and a lower BIC for the random intercept model, suggesting the random intercept is the better model to use because it is simpler and just as good.
    If you seperate by sex though, the random slope for age looks like it may be justified, atleast for males - but because we want to see if there is a difference by sex, we will not run sex as a random effect.

####5. In this exercise, we will test whether the relationship between **age** and **distance** is improved by the use of a non-linear quadratic function in the regression model (i.e. a growth curve model). 
    i) Based on your results in section 4 above, which model will you use as the basis for your growth curve model? **Justify your choice** [3 marks]
    	* Random intercept only (4i)?
    	
    	* Random intercept and slope (4ii)?
  
  I would use 4i because when doing a log-likelyhood test, the AIC was the same and the BIC was better for the simpler model, and one should always use the simpler model when two models perform the same.
    	 
    ii) Now perform a growth curve analysis by adding the term `age^2` to the model you have selected in 5i). [3 marks] 
    
```{r 5ii}
quadratic_model <- lme(distance ~ age + age^2, random = ~1|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)
```
    
    iii) Use the anova() function to perform a likelihood ratio test to compare the goodness-of-fit of the two models: 5ii) and either 4i) or 4ii). [3 marks]
```{r 5iii}
anova(long_randint_linear_model, quadratic_model)
```

    iv) In this study, does the use of a non-linear quadratic term for age improve the goodness-of-fit of the model? [3 marks]
    
    The use of a quadratic term for age does not improve the goodness of fit for this model.

####6. For our final model, we will now add the fixed effect **sex** to our model of the relationship between distance and age. 
    i) Which model would you choose as your final random effects model? [3 marks]
    	* Random intercept only with no quadratic term (linear model)
    	* Random intercept only with quadratic term (growth curve model)?
        * Random intercept and slope with no quadratic term (linear model)
    	* Random intercept and slope with quadratic term (growth curve model)?
    	
    	I would use the random intercept only with no qudratic term as my final model.
    	
    ii) Add the fixed effect **Sex** to the model chosen in 6i). Is there a significant relationship between distance and sex? [3 marks]
    
```{r 6ii}
model_fixed_sex <- lme(distance ~ age + Sex, random = ~1|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)

summary(model_fixed_sex)
```
    The fixed effect of sex shows that females have approximately 2.32 mm less distance between the petuitary and pterygomaxillary fissure and a significant p value of .0045, under .05.
    
    iii) Add an interaction term between the variables **sex** and **age**. Is this interaction significant? What does that mean? [3 marks]
    
```{r 6iii}
model_interaction_sex <- lme(distance ~ age + Sex + Sex:age, random = ~1|Subject,
                    data = Orthodont, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude)

summary(model_interaction_sex)
anova(model_fixed_sex, model_interaction_sex)
```
    The interaction between sex and age does seem significant with a p-value of .01. THis means that sex has an effect on the general trajectory - the growth curves look different - depending on sex. I touched upon this earlier when demonstrating the distance box plots by age when seperated by sex show different trends - female looking more linear and males lookingnon-linear.
    
####7. Based on your final model, write a paragraph to report the main findings of your analysis. Include the main statistical results supported by key values from the output (hint: use the intervals() function to obtain 95% intervals for your regression parameters). Provide a very brief clinical interpretation of your findings (hint: do the results support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between distance, age and sex?). [20 marks]

```{r}
intervals(model_fixed_sex)
intervals(model_interaction_sex)
```

Testing progressively more complicated models to determine if sex and age have an effect on distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, the least complicated model that showed significant improvement before introducing sex as a variable was a random intercept for each each subject. There were lower AIC's and BIC's or smaller log-likelihood functions until introducing a random slope for age. The 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient of age is .538 to .782, the distance between the fissures increases every year and the 95% confidence interval for SexFemale is between -3.83 and -.812 which means that the distance between the fissures is is smaller for females. Further,on average, the fissure distance increases about .66 mm per year and is 2.32 mm smaller for females compared to males. There also appears to be an interaction between sex and age, so the trend of distance increasing by age appears to be different between females and males.
  
To conclude, because the 95% confidence intervals for age and sex do not include 0, the hypothesis that distance and sex affect distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure is supported; both sex and age affect fissure distance.
